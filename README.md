# Machine Learning on VLSI - Practical Notebooks

Welcome to the repository for the practical part of the Machine Learning on VLSI course, part of EAMTA 2024. This repository hosts a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to provide hands-on experience with applying machine learning techniques in the field of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI).

## Course Overview

This course aims to introduce the fundamentals of machine learning with a focus on applications in VLSI design and analysis. Through these practical tasks, students will gain insights into how machine learning can be leveraged to optimize, analyze, and improve VLSI systems.

## Notebooks

- **'practical_tutorial.ipynb'**: A collection of machine learning theory with small practical examples included to illustrate the concepts.
- **'project.ipynb'**: A skeleton for a real machine learning project related to VLSI. Students are expected to fill in the missing code to complete the project.
- **'v2_GTSRB.ipynb'**: The solution notebook for the project, providing a reference for the expected outcomes and methodologies.
